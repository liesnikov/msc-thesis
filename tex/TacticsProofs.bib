  abstract = {Separation Logic is the twenty-first-century variant of Hoare Logic that permits verification of pointer-manipulating programs. This book covers practical and theoretical aspects of Separation Logic at a level accessible to beginning graduate students interested in software verification. On the practical side it offers an introduction to verification in Hoare and Separation logics, simple case studies for toy languages, and the Verifiable C program logic for the C programming language. On the theoretical side it presents separation algebras as models of separation logics; step-indexed models of higher-order logical features for higher-order programs; indirection theory for constructing step-indexed separation algebras; tree-shares as models for shared ownership; and the semantic construction (and soundness proof) of Verifiable C. In addition, the book covers several aspects of the CompCert verified C compiler, and its connection to foundationally verified software analysis tools. All constructions and proofs are made rigorous and accessible in the Coq developments of the open-source Verified Software Toolchain.},

We have developed a decision procedure on abelian rings in the Coq system but the approach we describe applies to all reduction systems that allow the definition of concrete types (or datatypes). We show that computational reflection is more efficient than an LCF-like approach to implement decision procedures in a reduction system. We discuss the concept of total reflection, which we have investigated in Coq using two facts: the extraction process available in Coq and the fact that the implementation language of the Coq system can be considered as a sublanguage of Coq. Total reflection is not yet implemented in Coq but we can test its performance as the extraction process is effective. Both reflection and total reflection are conservative extensions of the reduction system in which they are used. We also discuss performance and related approaches. In the paper,we assume basic knowledges of ML and proof-checkers.},

  abstract = {In this article, we investigate the logical structure of memory models of theoretical and practical interest. Our main interest is in ``the logic behind a fixed memory model'', rather than in ``a model of any kind behind a given logical system''. As an effective language for reasoning about such memory models, we use the formalism of separation logic. Our main result is that for any concrete choice of heap-like memory model, validity in that model is undecidable even for purely propositional formulas in this language. The main novelty of our approach to the problem is that we focus on validity in specific, concrete memory models, as opposed to validity in general classes of models. Besides its intrinsic technical interest, this result also provides new insights into the nature of their decidable fragments. In particular, we show that, in order to obtain such decidable fragments, either the formula language must be severely restricted or the valuations of propositional variables must be constrained. In addition, we show that a number of propositional systems that approximate separation logic are undecidable as well. In particular, this resolves the open problems of decidability for Boolean BI and Classical BI. Moreover, we provide one of the simplest undecidable propositional systems currently known in the literature, called ``Minimal Boolean BI'', by combining the purely positive implication-conjunction fragment of Boolean logic with the laws of multiplicative *-conjunction, its unit and its adjoint implication, originally provided by intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic. Each of these two components is individually decidable: the implication-conjunction fragment of Boolean logic is co-NP-complete, and intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic is NP-complete. All of our undecidability results are obtained by means of a direct encoding of Minsky machines.},

Our language is targeted at low-level programming of infrastructure like operating systems and runtime systems. It is based on a cross-platform core combining characteristics of assembly languages and compiler intermediate languages. From this foundation, we take literally the saying that C is a "macro assembly language": we introduce an expressive notion of certified low-level macros, sufficient to build up the usual features of C and beyond as macros with no special support in the core. Furthermore, our macros have integrated support for strongest postcondition calculation and verification condition generation, so that we can provide a high-productivity formal verification environment within Coq for programs composed from any combination of macros. Our macro interface is expressive enough to support features that low-level programs usually only access through external tools with no formal guarantees, such as declarative parsing or SQL-inspired querying. The abstraction level of these macros only imposes a compile-time cost, via the execution of functional Coq programs that compute programs in our intermediate language; but the run-time cost is not substantially greater than for more conventional C code. We describe our experiences constructing a full C-like language stack using macros, with some experiments on the verifiability and performance of individual programs running on that stack.},

Verifications based on automated theorem-proving have omitted reasoning about first-class code pointers, which is critical for tasks like certifying implementations of threads and processes. Conversely, verifications that deal with first-class code pointers have featured long, complex, manual proofs. In this paper, we introduce the Bedrock framework, which supports mostly-automated proofs about programs with the full range of features needed to implement, e.g., language runtime systems. The heart of our approach is in mostly-automated discharge of verification conditions inspired by separation logic. Our take on separation logic is computational, in the sense that function specifications are usually written in terms of reference implementations in a purely functional language. Logical quantifiers are the most challenging feature for most automated verifiers; by relying on functional programs (written in the expressive language of the Coq proof assistant), we are able to avoid quantifiers almost entirely. This leads to some dramatic improvements compared to both past work in classical verification, which we compare against with implementations of data structures like binary search trees and hash tables; and past work in verified programming with code pointers, which we compare against with examples like function memoization and a cooperative threading library.},

Currently, decision procedures can be written either in Type Theory--in a purely functional way that also ensures termination-- or in an effectful program- ming language, where they are used as oracles for the certified checker. The first option offers strong correctness guarantees, while the second one permits more efficient implementations. We propose a novel technique for proof-by-reflection that marries, in Type Theory, an effectful language with (partial) proofs of correctness. The key to our approach is to use simulable monads, where a monad is simulable if, for all terminating reduction sequences in its equivalent effectful computational model, there exists a witness from which the same reduction may be simulated a posteriori by the monad. We encode several examples using simulable monads and demonstrate the advantages of the technique over previous approaches.},

We give an algebraic method for calculating the distribution of the side-formul\ae{} in multiplicative rules which allows the occurrence or non-occurrence of a formula on a branch of a proof to be determined once sufficient information is available. Each formula in the conclusion of such a rule is assigned a Boolean expression. As a search proceeds, a set of Boolean constraint equations is generated. We show that a solution to such a set of equations determines a proof corresponding to the given search. We explain a range of strategies, from the lazy to the eager, for solving sets of constraint equations. We indicate how to apply our methods systematically to large family of relevant systems.},

We investigate the approach from the point of view of the logic BI of bunched implications of O'Hearnand Pym. We begin by giving a model in which the law of the excluded middleholds, thus showing that the approach is compatible with classical logic. The relationship between the intuitionistic and classical versions of the system is established by a translation, analogous to a translation from intuitionistic logic into the modal logic S4. We also consider the question of completeness of the axioms. BI's spatial implication is used to express weakest preconditions for object-component assignments, and an axiom for allocating a cons cell is shown to be complete under an interpretation of triplesthat allows a command to be applied to states with dangling pointers. We make this latter a feature, by incorporating an operation, and axiom, for disposing of memory. Finally, we describe a local character enjoyed by specifications in the logic, and show how this enables a class of frame axioms, which say what parts of the heap don't change, to be inferred automatically.},

The design of tactics makes it easy to combine them into higher-level automation that can be proved sound in a mostly automated way. Furthermore, unlike traditional uses of reflection, {$\mathsl{t}\mathsl{a}\mathsl{c}$}Rtac\textbackslash mathcal \{R\}\_\{tac\} tactics are independent of the underlying problem domain, which allows them to be re-tasked to automate new problems with very little effort. We demonstrate the usability of {$\mathsl{t}\mathsl{a}\mathsl{c}$}Rtac\textbackslash mathcal \{R\}\_\{tac\} through several case studies demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups for relatively little engineering work.},

These tactics enable the verification of partial correctness properties of complex pointer-intensive programs. Our goal is to make separation logic as easy to use as the standard logic of a proof assistant. We have developed tactics for the simplification, rearranging, splitting, matching and rewriting of separation logic assertions as well as the discharging of a program verification condition using a separation logic description of the machine state. We have implemented our tactics in the Coq proof assistant, applying them to a deep embedding of Cminor, a C-like intermediate language used by Leroy's verified CompCert compiler. We have used our tactics to verify the safety and completeness of a Cheney copying garbage collector written in Cminor. Our ideas should be applicable to other substructural logics and imperative languages.},

  abstract = {Most systems based on separation logic consider only restricted forms of implication or non-separating conjunction, as full support for these connectives requires a non-trivial notion of variable context, inherited from the logic of bunched implications (BI). We show that in an expressive type theory such as Coq, one can avoid the intricacies of BI, and support full separation logic very efficiently, using the native structuring primitives of the type theory. Our proposal uses reflection to enable equational reasoning about heaps, and Hoare triples with binary postconditions to further facilitate it. We apply these ideas to Hoare Type Theory, to obtain a new proof technique for verification of higher-order imperative programs that is general, extendable, and supports very short proofs, even without significant use of automation by tactics. We demonstrate the usability of the technique by verifying the fast congruence closure algorithm of Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras, employed in the state-of-the-art Barcelogic SAT solver.},

The assertion language is based on a possible worlds model of the logic of bunched implications, and includes spatial conjunction and implication connectives alongside those of classical logic. Heap operations are axiomatized using what we call the ``small axioms'', each of which mentions only those cells accessed by a particular command. Through these and a number of examples we show that the formalism supports local reasoning: A specification and proof can concentrate on only those cells in memory that a program accesses.},

The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a "separating conjunction" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related "separating implication". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing. In this paper, we survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures. We also discuss promising future directions.},

This API accompanies an entirely new implementation of the core tactic engine of Coq which aims at handling more gracefully existential variables (aka. metavariables) in proofs - like in more recent proof assistants like Matita and Agda2. We shall, then, leverage this newly acquired independence of the concrete type of tactics from the API to add backtracking abilities.},
