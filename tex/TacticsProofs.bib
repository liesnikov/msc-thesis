  abstract = {We consider the problem of searching for proofs in sequential presentations of logics with multiplicative (or intensional) connectives. Specifically, we start with the multiplicative fragment of linear logic and extend, on the one hand, to linear logic with its additives and, on the other, to the additives of the logic of bunched implications (BI). We give an algebraic method for calculating the distribution of the side-formul\ae{} in multiplicative rules which allows the occurrence or non-occurrence of a formula on a branch of a proof to be determined once sufficient information is available. Each formula in the conclusion of such a rule is assigned a Boolean expression. As a search proceeds, a set of Boolean constraint equations is generated. We show that a solution to such a set of equations determines a proof corresponding to the given search. We explain a range of strategies, from the lazy to the eager, for solving sets of constraint equations. We indicate how to apply our methods systematically to large family of relevant systems.},

Iris was designed with the express goal of simplifying and consolidating the foundations of modern separation logics, but it has evolved over time, and the design and semantic foundations of Iris itself have yet to be fully written down and explained together properly in one place. Here, we attempt to fill this gap, presenting a reasonably complete picture of the latest version of Iris (version 3.1), from first principles and in one coherent narrative.},

Inspired by logic programming, our library provides, in addition to the operations required by the MonadPlus interface, constructs for fair disjunctions, fair conjunctions, conditionals, pruning, and an expressive top-level interface. Implementing these additional constructs is easy in models of backtracking based on streams, but not known to be possible in continuation-based models. We show that all these additional constructs can be generically and monadically realized using a single primitive msplit. We present two implementations of the library: one using success and failure continuations; and the other using control operators for manipulating delimited continuations.},

Our goal is to make separation logic as easy to use as the standard logic of a proof assistant. We have developed tactics for the simplification, rearranging, splitting, matching and rewriting of separation logic assertions as well as the discharging of a program verification condition using a separation logic description of the machine state. We have implemented our tactics in the Coq proof assistant, applying them to a deep embedding of Cminor, a C-like intermediate language used by Leroy's verified CompCert compiler. We have used our tactics to verify the safety and completeness of a Cheney copying garbage collector written in Cminor. Our ideas should be applicable to other substructural logics and imperative languages.},

Heap operations are axiomatized using what we call the ``small axioms'', each of which mentions only those cells accessed by a particular command. Through these and a number of examples we show that the formalism supports local reasoning: A specification and proof can concentrate on only those cells in memory that a program accesses.},

This API accompanies an entirely new implementation of the core tactic engine of Coq which aims at handling more gracefully existential variables (aka. metavariables) in proofs - like in more recent proof assistants like Matita and Agda2. We shall, then, leverage this newly acquired independence of the concrete type of tactics from the API to add backtracking abilities.},
