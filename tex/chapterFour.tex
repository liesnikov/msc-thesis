\subsection{Motivation/examples}

\subsection{Rules for environments with constraints}

\subsubsection{Alternatives for destructing existentials}

\begin{enumerate}
\item for introduced variables

\begin{itemize}
\item proving the type is inhabited
\item guarding the introduced variable with a proof that constraint is true
\item conditional Maybe
\end{itemize}
\item for propositions

\begin{itemize}
\item conditional empty
\item whole environemnts with proofs of constraints that constraint is equal to true quantified
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{The need to solve constraints afterwards for modalities with action "clear"}

\subsection{Design implemented}

\subsection{Possible designs and comparisons, what do we need}

\subsubsection{Continuation-style environments}

\subsubsection{Boolean constraints with existential variables}

\subsubsection{Boolean constraints resolved post-factum with equations posed as goals}

\subsubsection{Different styles of environemnts?}

\subsection{Ltac2 features used}

"Reflection on the use of Ltac2"
Mention that Ltac2 was complete for our puposes
