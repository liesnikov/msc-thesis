\chapter{Reimplementation of IPM in Ltac2}

tutorial-style

take an example and work it out in Ltac2

\section{Iris Proof Mode setup}

Explain what is IPM, judgements, tactics as proof rules for the judgment

\subsection{Rules for regular IPM}

MoSeL paper only has a handful of them, so maybe it makes sense to put all here for comparison with "splitting" ones later?

\paragraph{Tactics compose}

\section{IPM from implementaion persprective}

How to implement tactic in IPM, how does IPM work

\section{Examples of Ltac2 features are/can be used}

\paragraph{Fix arities from original IPM}

\paragraph{Error messages}

\begin{itemize}
\item nested exceptions, rethrowing errors, example: iintros uses idestruct
\item there's more to do here -- I haven't touched Typeclass search yet and not sure there's much I can do in general
\end{itemize}

\section{Missing from Ltac2: notations for intropatterns, user-defined scopes?}

\paragraph{Interop between Ltac1 and Ltac2?}
i.e. iris indent-string has to go through the goal to get the result from one to another
