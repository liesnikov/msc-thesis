I would like to thank Prof. Dreyer for suggesting this topic and being my supervisor for the thesis.
However, he did much more than this, he supported and mentored me all the way through my Master's studies and I am extremely grateful for that.

I would also like to thank Dr. Krebbers for providing constant feedback and guiding me through the process of development of the thesis.
I'm also indebted to Michael Sammler, Ike Mudler and Coq community at large for fruitful discussions and helpful suggestions.

Finally, but perhaps, most importantly, I would like to thank my family and friends.
You know who you are.
I wouldn't make it even half-way without your support and love.
Without the time we spent together.
Without your help.
Thank you.
