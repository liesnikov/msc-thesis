# Introduction

## Motivation

* One of the key elements of Iris success has been Iris Proof Mode \autocite{krebbersInteractiveProofsHigherorder2017}.
* In 2018, it was extended to MoSeL \autocite{krebbersMoSeLGeneralExtensible2018} -- a general framework for interactive proofs in separation logic.
* Can we do more for MoSeL?

## Motivation #1: Ltac

* MoSeL is implemented in Ltac
* There are multiple complains about Ltac, people are calling it names (and for a good reason!)
* Why don't we try reimplementing MoSeL in some other tactic language?
* Ltac2 is the new kid on the block
* Claims to be a sane successor to Ltac1
* Let's try it and see if we can do something cool along the way

## Motivation #2: \textnormal{\LARGE \texttt{iSplit}}

* It is annoying to provide resources explicitly every time you introduce a star
* Same goes for \coqe{iApply}
* Prior work: \citeauthor{harlandResourceDistributionBooleanConstraints2003} developed a solution based on Boolean flags
* Ltac1 is bad for working with evars, let's see if Ltac2 is better!

# Crash course in Ltac2

## ML-family language

## Notations

## Exceptions, mutable datatypes, and others

## Semantics

# iMatch

## Matching goals in Ltac/Ltac2

## Matching goals in MoSeL

## Different environments

## iLazyMatch, iMultiMatch

# iSplit

## Problem setting

## Solution by Harland and Pym

## How to port to MoSeL

## New environments
